## Summary of earlier modifications (M1–M17)

| # | Date | Title | Problem | Modification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | 10-08 | **Spotify account linking with a Premium gate** | Spotify only lets Premium accounts control playback. | First-run "Connect Spotify" window; the account's plan is checked; non-Premium accounts are refused and nothing is saved. Scope `user-read-private`. |
| M2 | 10-08 | **Sign-in without the developer's keys (PKCE)** | The client-secret flow tied the app to the developer's keys. | Authorization Code + PKCE; no secret shipped; public Client ID in `config.json`. |
| M3 | 10-08 | **Several accounts, choice at launch, Log out** | One account per computer; no way to switch. | Account window on every launch; active account + Log out in the sidebar and tray; the daemon follows the active account. |
| M4 | 10-08 | **Repository reorganized** | A half-finished reorganization by another session. | Reverted and redone: `config/`, `backend/spotify/`, `data/spotify_accounts/`, `tests/backend|frontend/`, `docs/`. |
| M5 | 10-08 | **SPEC/PLAN back at the root; PLAN text repaired** | PLAN.md garbled by an encoding error. | Moved back; repaired to UTF-8. |
| M6 | 10-08 | **Phase 2 planned** | Spotify's API can't insert into or remove from the queue. | Design: private "Ambient Mood session" playlist; mood = queue average; Markov waypoint, catalog search, MMR, cheapest insertion, removal rule. |
| M7 | 10-08 | **Phase 2 implemented** | (the plan above) | Session playlist with seamless hand-over; add/remove cycles every 90 s; 89,741-track catalog; hand-back and delete at the end. 179 tests. |
| M8 | 10-08 | **First live run fixes** | Daemon crashed at startup (cache handler type); playlist delete returned 403; tests used the live config. | Cache handler fixed; unfollow first; tests reset the config. Found: many Telugu/Hindi songs have no mood data. |
| M9 | 10-08 | **Second live run: takeover bug, random inserts, clearing on mood change** | Sessions ended a second after starting; two overlapping steps made two playlists. | Grace period + 2-cycle takeover rule; serialized steps; random insert positions (default); a new target clears up to 5 unfitting songs. |
| M10 | 10-08 | **Third live run: autoplay taken for the user's queue** | With an empty queue, Spotify's autoplay was protected and nothing was added. | `manual_prefix_length` = 0 when the playlist has no upcoming songs. |
| M11 | 10-08 | **Fourth live run: edits not reaching Spotify's queue** | Spotify plays a snapshot of the playlist. | Resync after edits (same song, same moment); stale-snapshot songs skipped; user-queued songs matched against both copies. |
| M12 | 10-10 | **Deployable release + development setup** | Users can't run two terminals; Program Files is read-only; catalog needed a command. | The tray app runs the daemon; single instance; `%APPDATA%\AmbientMood` for user data; PyInstaller + Inno Setup installer; `main`/`dev` branches; flaky watcher test fixed. |
| M13 | 10-10 | **Uninstall/upgrade closes the app cleanly (0.1.1)** | The uninstaller force-killed the app, leaving the session playlist and a warm screen. | The app quits normally when `%APPDATA%\AmbientMood\data\app.quit` appears (also on the account window); the (un)installer creates it and waits up to 40 s. |
| M14 | 10-11 | **Song recommender: taste + mood + top-2 languages** | Songs came from a 2022 dataset by mood only: not the user's taste or languages, no new releases. | New `recommender/` package. Taste profile (Spotify top tracks + Moodly plays/skips); top-2 languages; songs of favourite + Deezer-related artists via Spotify search (incl. the last two years); language from marker → script → LRCLIB lyrics → romanized words → artist; mood features via ReccoBeats or an iTunes preview analysed by ReccoBeats; selection adds a language filter and `− 0.12·taste − 0.03·freshness`. Live: Telugu 52%, Hindi 33%; pool 36 → 66 → 86 songs. 218 tests. |
| M15 | 10-11 | **Session buttons and a song pool prepared per session** | Before the pool was ready, and when it had nothing near a step, random catalog songs (any language) were added; sessions started on their own. | Sidebar: Start session (at launch), End session, New session. On start, new session and every target change the session "prepares": nothing is added until the pool holds 15 useful songs (max 10 min; 2 songs kept ahead so music never stops). The pool is aimed at the goal (songs leading away are pruned); no catalog songs for mood steps; the pool is cleared from disk at session end. 222 tests. |
| M16 | 10-11 | **Release 0.2.0 for Windows and Mac** | M14–M15 were only on `dev`; no Mac installer. | Mac support (data in `~/Library/Application Support`, VS Code path per platform, sidebar under the menu bar); `build_mac.sh` + GitHub workflow build Apple silicon and Intel `.dmg` files on release; config with a BOM accepted; `dev` merged into `main`, `v0.2.0` released with plain-language notes. 224 tests. |
| M17 | 10-12 | **Live sidebar and glass design that follows the mood** | Song, mood dot and details lagged up to a minute and weren't in sync; the sidebar didn't match the reference glass design. | Spotify polled every 3 s (and right after a song ends); mood re-averaged when a song starts; `state.json` written at once on visible changes and watched by the UI; live progress bar. Sidebar rebuilt after `Glass design UI.jpg` (rows with glass pill + edge bar + chevron, account row); tint follows the mood (amber/rose/violet/teal) and glides. 228 tests. |

## M18 · Real glass: transparent, blurred background, round corners · 2026-10-12 · `🆕 LATEST`

**Problems (seen on screen):**
1. Square edges showed around the rounded corners.
2. The glass looked thick and opaque instead of transparent with the background blurred.

**Cause (found by capturing the sidebar on screen over a colourful background):** the Windows Acrylic call (`SetWindowCompositionAttribute`) doesn't blur behind Qt's transparent windows here. It paints **black** across the window's full **rectangle**. That black, under the painted glass (70–85% opaque), was both the thick look and the square corners. Clipping the window to a rounded mask didn't help.

**Modifications** (`frontend/app.py`):
1. **Acrylic call removed** (`enable_acrylic`); no DWM corner preference.
2. **Own blur:**
   - `GlassWindow.capture_backdrop()` snapshots the screen where the sidebar will appear, while it is still hidden (`show_sidebar()` calls it before `show()`).
   - `blur_pixmap()` blurs the snapshot: shrink by ~7×, then 2×, then scale back up smoothly.
   - `paintEvent` draws the snapshot first, so what's behind shows through, blurred. This works the same on Windows and macOS (on macOS without the Screen Recording permission the snapshot holds only the wallpaper).
3. **Thinner glass** over the blur:
   - tint alpha 125 → 80 → 70 from top to bottom (was 215 → 175 → 170)
   - diagonal bands 80/40 (was 120/60)
   - without a snapshot, +95 alpha so text stays readable
4. **Round corners only:** everything is painted inside the rounded path, and nothing fills the rectangle behind it.

**Checked on screen:**
- the sidebar over the reference image in Calm and Energized (`docs/sidebar.png`)
- the background shows through, blurred, with round corners and no square edges
- the tint is still visible and the text is readable

**Tests:** 229 pass (new: the blur softens a sharp pattern; opening the sidebar takes a snapshot first).

**Not done / limits:**
- The blurred background is a snapshot from when the sidebar opens: something moving behind it (a video) isn't updated until it is reopened. The sidebar is a short-lived flyout, which keeps this acceptable.
