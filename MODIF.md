## Summary of earlier modifications (M1–M20)

| # | Date | Title | Problem | Modification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | 10-08 | **Spotify account linking with a Premium gate** | Spotify only lets Premium accounts control playback. | First-run "Connect Spotify" window; the account's plan is checked; non-Premium accounts are refused and nothing is saved. Scope `user-read-private`. |
| M2 | 10-08 | **Sign-in without the developer's keys (PKCE)** | The client-secret flow tied the app to the developer's keys. | Authorization Code + PKCE; no secret shipped; public Client ID in `config.json`. |
| M3 | 10-08 | **Several accounts, choice at launch, Log out** | One account per computer; no way to switch. | Account window on every launch; active account + Log out in the sidebar and tray; the daemon follows the active account. |
| M4 | 10-08 | **Repository reorganized** | A half-finished reorganization by another session. | Reverted and redone: `config/`, `backend/spotify/`, `data/spotify_accounts/`, `tests/backend|frontend/`, `docs/`. |
| M5 | 10-08 | **SPEC/PLAN back at the root; PLAN text repaired** | PLAN.md garbled by an encoding error. | Moved back; repaired to UTF-8. |
| M6 | 10-08 | **Phase 2 planned** | Spotify's API can't insert into or remove from the queue. | Design: private "Ambient Mood session" playlist; mood = queue average; Markov waypoint, catalog search, MMR, cheapest insertion, removal rule. |
| M7 | 10-08 | **Phase 2 implemented** | (the plan above) | Session playlist with seamless hand-over; add/remove cycles every 90 s; 89,741-track catalog; hand-back and delete at the end. 179 tests. |
| M8 | 10-08 | **First live run fixes** | Daemon crashed at startup (cache handler type); playlist delete returned 403; tests used the live config. | Cache handler fixed; unfollow first; tests reset the config. Found: many Telugu/Hindi songs have no mood data. |
| M9 | 10-08 | **Second live run: takeover bug, random inserts, clearing on mood change** | Sessions ended a second after starting; two overlapping steps made two playlists. | Grace period + 2-cycle takeover rule; serialized steps; random insert positions (default); a new target clears up to 5 unfitting songs. |
| M10 | 10-08 | **Third live run: autoplay taken for the user's queue** | With an empty queue, Spotify's autoplay was protected and nothing was added. | `manual_prefix_length` = 0 when the playlist has no upcoming songs. |
| M11 | 10-08 | **Fourth live run: edits not reaching Spotify's queue** | Spotify plays a snapshot of the playlist. | Resync after edits (same song, same moment); stale-snapshot songs skipped; user-queued songs matched against both copies. |
| M12 | 10-10 | **Deployable release + development setup** | Users can't run two terminals; Program Files is read-only; catalog needed a command. | The tray app runs the daemon; single instance; `%APPDATA%\AmbientMood` for user data; PyInstaller + Inno Setup installer; `main`/`dev` branches; flaky watcher test fixed. |
| M13 | 10-10 | **Uninstall/upgrade closes the app cleanly (0.1.1)** | The uninstaller force-killed the app, leaving the session playlist and a warm screen. | The app quits normally when `%APPDATA%\AmbientMood\data\app.quit` appears (also on the account window); the (un)installer creates it and waits up to 40 s. |
| M14 | 10-11 | **Song recommender: taste + mood + top-2 languages** | Songs came from a 2022 dataset by mood only: not the user's taste or languages, no new releases. | New `recommender/` package. Taste profile (Spotify top tracks + Moodly plays/skips); top-2 languages; songs of favourite + Deezer-related artists via Spotify search (incl. the last two years); language from marker → script → LRCLIB lyrics → romanized words → artist; mood features via ReccoBeats or an iTunes preview analysed by ReccoBeats; selection adds a language filter and `− 0.12·taste − 0.03·freshness`. Live: Telugu 52%, Hindi 33%; pool 36 → 66 → 86 songs. 218 tests. |
| M15 | 10-11 | **Session buttons and a song pool prepared per session** | Before the pool was ready, and when it had nothing near a step, random catalog songs (any language) were added; sessions started on their own. | Sidebar: Start session (at launch), End session, New session. On start, new session and every target change the session "prepares": nothing is added until the pool holds 15 useful songs (max 10 min; 2 songs kept ahead so music never stops). The pool is aimed at the goal (songs leading away are pruned); no catalog songs for mood steps; the pool is cleared from disk at session end. 222 tests. |
| M16 | 10-11 | **Release 0.2.0 for Windows and Mac** | M14–M15 were only on `dev`; no Mac installer. | Mac support (data in `~/Library/Application Support`, VS Code path per platform, sidebar under the menu bar); `build_mac.sh` + GitHub workflow build Apple silicon and Intel `.dmg` files on release; config with a BOM accepted; `dev` merged into `main`, `v0.2.0` released with plain-language notes. 224 tests. |
| M17 | 10-12 | **Live sidebar and glass design that follows the mood** | Song, mood dot and details lagged up to a minute and weren't in sync; the sidebar didn't match the reference glass design. | Spotify polled every 3 s (and right after a song ends); mood re-averaged when a song starts; `state.json` written at once on visible changes and watched by the UI; live progress bar. Sidebar rebuilt after `Glass design UI.jpg` (rows with glass pill + edge bar + chevron, account row); tint follows the mood (amber/rose/violet/teal) and glides. 228 tests. |
| M18 | 10-12 | **Real glass: transparent, blurred background, round corners** | Square edges and thick, opaque glass: the Windows Acrylic call painted black behind Qt's transparent window, in a full rectangle. | Acrylic call removed; a snapshot of the screen behind the sidebar is taken as it opens, blurred and drawn under thinner glass (tint alpha 125/80/70). Same on Windows and macOS; checked on screen. 229 tests. |
| M19 | 10-12 | **Pointer effects** | The sidebar should react to the mouse like modern websites. | A light in the mood colour followed the pointer and the edge shone near it; rows: hover pill fade, inner light, icon nudge, click ripple; the selection slides between moods; mood map crosshair readout and breathing dot. 232 tests. |
| M20 | 10-12 | **Waves instead of the pointer light, bolder text, no crosshair or window dots** | The pointer light was too bright and hid the text; the text should be bolder; the map crosshair and window dots weren't wanted. | Soft waves behind the text when the pointer moves (one per 38 px, fade over 1.6 s); `ui_font()` with heavier weights; crosshair, readout and window dots removed. 232 tests. |

## M21 · Mood path trace and live plot, for testing · 2026-10-12 · `🆕 LATEST`

**Request:** while songs play, see the path of the mood toward the target, cycle by cycle, in a detailed and accurate plot. This is for testing only; users don't get it.

**Modifications:**
1. **Trace** (`backend/trace.py`, hooked into `PlaylistSession`):
   - Off unless the environment variable `AMBIENT_MOOD_TRACE` names a file. The tray app passes its environment on to the daemon.
   - Writes one JSON line per event:
     - `cycle`: reason, target, mood (queue average), deviation, waypoint and Markov direction, settled / preparing / waiting-for-songs flags, queue size, every song in the window with its (valence, energy), and the songs added (point, position, `plan` or `keep music going`) and removed.
     - `song`: a new song started, with the mood re-averaged at once.
     - `end`: the session ended.
   - A timer cycle that changed nothing is not written again.
   - The values are the same numbers the session uses (no recomputation).
2. **Live viewer** (`tools/mood_trace_view.py`, Python standard library only):
   - Run with `python -m tools.mood_trace_view` and open http://127.0.0.1:8765. It re-reads the trace every 2 s.
   - **Mood plane:** the 10×10 Markov grid, quadrant names and mood presets; the mood path numbered and coloured old to new, with arrows; song-change steps; waypoints, linked to the mood they started from; songs added; the target, with 0.05/0.1/0.2 rings; optionally the current queue's songs. Hover any point for its details.
   - **Panels:** current stats (distance now and at the start, % closed, cycles, songs added and removed); distance to the target over time; valence and energy over time against the target; a step table with every song added and removed.
   - Each session is shown separately and can be picked from a list.
3. `data/mood_trace.jsonl` is git-ignored.

**Checked:** a mock-Spotify run (calm target) plotted correctly: the mood went from (0.90, 0.95) toward (0.60, 0.25), and 64% of the distance was closed in 25 cycles.

**Tests:** 233 pass. New: the trace is off by default; with it on, it records cycle, song and end events with points, waypoint and added songs, and skips a cycle that changed nothing.
